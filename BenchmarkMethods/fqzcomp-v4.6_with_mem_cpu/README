# fqz_comp v4.6
# Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fqzcomp/

# Compilation
cp Makefile.linux Makefile2.linux
mv Makefile2.linux Makefile
make

# Run
To compress:
    ./fqz_comp -s5 -q3 input_file.fastq output_file.fqz

To decompress
    ./fqz_comp -d input_file.fqz output_file.fastq


# Options

-s <level>
    Specifies the size of the sequence context. Increasing this will
    improve compression on large data sets, but each increment in
    level will quadruple the memory used by the sequence compression
    steps. Further more increasing it too high may harm compression on
    small files.

    Specifying a "+" after level will use two context sizes (eg -s5+);
    a small fixed size and the <level> specified. This greatly helps
    compression of small files and also slightly helps compression of
    larger files.

    Defaults to -s3.

-q <level>
    Specifies the degree of quality compression, with a value from -q1
    to -q3.

    -q1
        Uses the previous quality value and the maximum of the two
        previous to that as a context for predicting the next value.
        Combined this adds 12 bits of context.

    -q2
        In addition to -q1, this extends the context by adding a
        single bit to indicate if the 2nd and 3rd previous qualities
        are identical to each other, as well as using 3 bits of
        context for the running-delta. (A measure of how variable a
	string of quality values are.) This is the default level.

     -q3
        As per -q2, but also adds 4 bits worth of context holding the
        position each the sequence.
